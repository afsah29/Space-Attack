# Space-Attack
This Python project underscores my adeptness in game development and graphics programming. I've utilized the Turtle graphics library to craft an immersive "Space Attack" game, featuring single-player and multiplayer modes. Within the game, dynamic player-controlled characters, score management, and intricate level transitions are implemented through a robust foundation of object-oriented principles. Additionally, I've adeptly incorporated event handling for user input and intricately engineered game mechanics, encompassing player movement, enemy AI, and collision detection.
